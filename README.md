# Odoo-Design-Exercise
Convert a mock-up into a static HTML page

Hello Odoo team, you will find my coded mock-up in this repo.

First of all,

I know I had a week to do this exercise but I will be on holiday until Monday the 16th (the day when I'm supposed the publish the website).
That's why I posted it earlier. I've done it in about 2 days, during my free time.

I wish I had more time to even better use the bootstraps variables, in order to speed up, I used a lot flexbox. And more time to make it fully responsive!!
There is a few elements missing, I'm totally aware of it, but my aim was to show you that I was able to translate a mock-up in code in a quite quick time.
I also struggled to find the font you used, mine is definitely not as good.

I like de modernity of this template, peps colors, rounded buttons and shapes (like rasor blade) and the fact that there isn't a lot of text. The differents cards are rendering really good aswell.
The common user is bored of reading in 2021, he need to understand where he is really quick.

I wouldn't have choose the navy blue in the banner and the footer, not a great fan of the mix with the primary blue (wich I really like by the way).
I would also have respected  the margin in the "Awards" section.

If I had to redo the mock-up, I think, I would have put a nice carousel for the awards cards, and the footer is quite heavy and boring. In the real website, I would put some animations with the path that going from card to card.

For the rest I think it's a nice website, I'd like to have it for my company.
